			<h3 style = 'color: black' class = 'text-center'>Wernicke’s Day Off is about more than just creating music. They’re about creating an experience. Going out of their way not to adhere to industry norms, the group works tirelessly to create a fresh, unique, and groundbreaking sound. As Leonard Peacock puts, “we’re the Alternative of Alternative music.” Wernicke’s Day Off has tracks that range from humorous, folksy fun to haunting, alien ballads. They pride themselves on a sound that can’t be identified with a single genre, a single word. Inspired by the likes of Gorrilaz, Queen, and the underground music movements of the early 2010s, WDO strives to make the listener question everything they knew about music, and redefine their boundaries of sound.</h3>

			<h2 class = 'text-center'><i>Leonard Peacock</i><br /></h2>
			<h3 class = 'text-center'>Lead Singer and Banjo</h3>
			<p class = 'text-center'>Leonard Peacock, formerly known as Jeremiah Hansen, is the lead singer and banjo artist behind Wernicke’s Day Off. Born on March 23, 1995 in Tuscon, Arizona, Leonard grew up in a family that despised the use of music. Claiming it to be nothing more than useless whitenoise, Leonard was opted out of his school’s music program. As a rebellious teenager, he fled from home to Pheonix, Arizona. There, he took refuge at a small music club, paying for local rent by working in various music shops. Here, he was exposed to music for the first time in his life, and he fell in love immediately. He would spend hours after work listening to any record he could find, and it became his dream to create music of his own. Leonard opted to learn the banjo, and found a local vocal coach to help train his voice. After putting flyers out around the city, he managed to assemble a small gathering of aspiring musicians. From this motley crew, Wernicke’s Day Off was born.</p> 
			<p class = 'text-center'>Leonard, now 24, is a happy bachelor, preferring to focus on his music over his personal relationships. Never a stranger to something new, he scours the internet for new sounds and styles. Since he departed from his biological family, he has refused to communicate with them, claiming nobody should be denied the moving power of music. He claims, over anything, it is a creative release, and should be enjoyed as such. This ideology is what has allowed Leonard the creative freedom to express himself the way he never could as a child, and is the driving force behind the group.</p>

			<h2 class = 'text-center'><i>Carl Wernicke</i><br /></h2>
			<h3 class = 'text-center'>Bass and Backup Vocals</h3>
			<p class = 'text-center'>Carl Wernicke, born on July 12, 1988 in Mesa, Arizona, is the lead bassist and backup vocalist for the group. Living in poverty for most of his life, Carl struggled to fully realize his passion for music. Being forced into a house cleaning business at an unusually young age in order to support his alcoholic father, Carl failed to gain the classic American childhood most parents strive to provide. At age 14, Carl’s mother passed away, and with a father unwilling to support his child, Carl was given up to Child Protective Services. However, one of Carl’s clients, the Gardeners, adopted the child and took him under their wing. Being a musically inclined family, they urged Carl to embrace the art of music, giving him his first guitar at age 15. After graduating high school, Carl ventured to Phoenix, where after struggling to find success in the music industry he stumbled across a flyer for an aspiring band. He met Leonard Peacock, who was inspired by his story. Leonard named the band in Carl’s honor, and from that point on Carl was cemented as a key member of the band.</p>

			<h3 class = 'text-center'>Backup Instruments</h3>
			<p>Paul Broca, born Luca Balti on January 30, 1990 in Naples, Italy, is the backup guitarist, backup drummer, and backup vocalist of the band. Growing up, Luca was the son of a small Italian business owner. One day when his family refused to give into the mafia’s demands of a “business protection fee”, his family was put in jeopardy. After coming home from school one fateful day, Luca found his parents brutally murdered in their store front. For his own protection, he fled Italy to Phoenix, Arizona with the help of a family friend, and disguised himself Paul Broca. To reconcile after his parents’ deaths he searched high and low for something that could occupy his time and mind. On the verge of another break-down over his parents murders, Paul found his love of music in a local Phoenix music store, where he fostered his love of playing the bass, drums, and guitar. After years of honing his musical talent, Paul found one of Leonard’s flyers and decided to join the band after proving his musical skills to Leonard and Carl. He decided to join Wernicke’s day off to spread his love of music with the world, even though he vows to never tour in Italy due to the lasting emotional trauma.</p>

			<p class = 'text-center'>Abraham Maslow, born in June 10, 1993 in Phoenix Arizona, is the technician and sound board operator. Abraham was born to a wealthy real estate mogul. His mother pushed him to excel in music during his upbringing, which prompted him to make it his career in adulthood. He especially loved controlling the sounds of others’ music to produce a result that both him and the artist were happy with. After he started to live on his own, he found one of Leonard’s flyers posted outside of his favorite music store. Inspired by their tragic pasts, Abraham decided to commit a large sum of inheritance to supporting the group, and eventually found himself a key member, mixing sounds and perfecting flows. In his free time, he volunteers at local youth music centers to foster the next generation of musicians.</p>
